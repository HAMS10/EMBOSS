 Parsing of ACD files does not constitute a "derived work" and developers are
 encouraged to do this, for example to write their own GUIs.

 For developers who have their own licensing conditions already in effect, there
 will be an additional way to contribute. The EMBASSY collection can include
 packages that use the EMBOSS core libraries and interfaces but under their own
 licensing conditions. They will be bound by the Library GPL of the AJAX and
 NUCLEUS libraries, but not necessarily by the full GPL.
 .
 Some of the suggestions and code examples from David Hanson's book
 "C Interfaces and Implementations" are included in the AJAX library.

 The EMBOSS package for Debian was initially prepared by Matt Hope
 (dopey@debian.org) in 2002-2004 and released on
 (http://debian.bioinformatics.unsw.edu.au/). The package distributed in Debian
 was prepared by the "pkg-emboss" project in 2006, using the work of Matt Hope
 as a starting point. The packaging work of the pkg-emboss project is in the
 public domain unless stated otherwise.
