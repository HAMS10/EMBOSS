- Use libpcre from Debian (needs #387557)
- Check if external applications use the nucleus or ajax libraries (as a
  consequence, emboss-lib would need to be separated into libnucleus4 and
  libajax4).
- Design an easy build system for embassy (makefile includes shipped in emboss-data?)
- Implement tests.
