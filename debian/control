Description: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite
 EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially developed for
 the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user community. The software
 automatically copes with data in a variety of formats and even allows
 transparent retrieval of sequence data from the web. Also, as extensive
 libraries are provided with the package, it is a platform to allow other
 scientists to develop and release software in true open source spirit. EMBOSS
 also integrates a range of currently available packages and tools for sequence
 analysis into a seamless whole. EMBOSS breaks the historical trend towards
 commercial software packages.

 AJAX covers standard data structures, including strings, sequences, file
 handles, queues, hashes, heaps, lists, dictionaries, trees and dynamic
 arrays. It also covers standard algorithms including comparisons, pattern
 matching, sorting, and iterators. AJAX will also provide a set of high level
 graphics functions suited to the needs of sequence analysis applications.
