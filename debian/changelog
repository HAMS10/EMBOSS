emboss (6.0.1-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream patch (patch-1-8):
      Incorrect information was often given in the subsidiary table
      listing REs that would cut a greater number of times than an
      optional user-supplied maximum number. The main role of
      the program was unaffected.
