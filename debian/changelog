emboss (6.0.1-4) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  TODO: Let's wait the end of the freeze to upload to unstable. After this, it
  would be much safer to rebuild the embassy packages and update their
  orig.tar.gz, that did not change name upstream but was modified.

  * New upstream patch (patch-1-4), removing unnecessary whitespaces in
    edialign.acd.
  * debian/control uses the official homepage URL as confirmed by Upstream.
