.RE
.PP
\fB\-oligomishyblibraryfile\fR \fIinfile\fR
.RS 4
Similar to MISPRIMING\-LIBRARY, except that the event we seek to avoid is hybridization of the internal oligo to sequences in this library rather than priming from them. The file must be in (a slightly restricted) FASTA format (W. B. Pearson and D.J. Lipman, PNAS 85:8 pp 2444\-2448 [1988]); we briefly discuss the organization of this file below. If this parameter is specified then EPrimer3 locally aligns each candidate oligo against each library sequence and rejects those primers for which the local alignment score times a specified weight (see below) exceeds INTERNAL\-OLIGO\-MAX\-MISHYB. (The maximum value of the weight is arbitrarily set to 12.0.) Each sequence entry in the FASTA\-format file must begin with an 'id line' that starts with '>'. The contents of the id line is 'slightly restricted' in that EPrimer3 parses everything after any optional asterisk ('*') as a floating point number to use as the weight mentioned above. If the id line contains no asterisk then the weight defaults to 1.0. The alignment scoring system used is the same as for calculating complementarity among oligos (e.g. SELF\-ANY). The remainder of an entry contains the sequence as lines following the id line up until a line starting with '>' or the end of the file. Whitespace and newlines are ignored. Characters 'A', 'T', 'G', 'C', 'a', 't', 'g', 'c' are retained and any other character is converted to 'N' (with the consequence that any IUB / IUPAC codes for ambiguous bases are converted to 'N'). There are no restrictions on line length. An empty value for this parameter indicates that no library should be used.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-mispriminglibraryfile\fR \fIinfile\fR
.RS 4
The name of a file containing a nucleotide sequence library of sequences to avoid amplifying (for example repetitive sequences, or possibly the sequences of genes in a gene family that should not be amplified.) The file must be in (a slightly restricted) FASTA format (W. B. Pearson and D.J. Lipman, PNAS 85:8 pp 2444\-2448 [1988]); we briefly discuss the organization of this file below. If this parameter is specified then EPrimer3 locally aligns each candidate primer against each library sequence and rejects those primers for which the local alignment score times a specified weight (see below) exceeds MAX\-MISPRIMING. (The maximum value of the weight is arbitrarily set to 100.0.) Each sequence entry in the FASTA\-format file must begin with an 'id line' that starts with '>'. The contents of the id line is 'slightly restricted' in that EPrimer3 parses everything after any optional asterisk ('*') as a floating point number to use as the weight mentioned above. If the id line contains no asterisk then the weight defaults to 1.0. The alignment scoring system used is the same as for calculating complementarity among oligos (e.g. SELF\-ANY). The remainder of an entry contains the sequence as lines following the id line up until a line starting with '>' or the end of the file. Whitespace and newlines are ignored. Characters 'A', 'T', 'G', 'C', 'a', 't', 'g', 'c' are retained and any other character is converted to 'N' (with the consequence that any IUB / IUPAC codes for ambiguous bases are converted to 'N'). There are no restrictions on line length. An empty value for this parameter indicates that no repeat library should be used.

\fB\-numreturn\fR \fIinteger\fR
.RS 4
The maximum number of primer pairs to return. Primer pairs returned are sorted by their 'quality', in other words by the value of the objective function (where a lower number indicates a better primer pair). Caution: setting this parameter to a large value will increase running time. Default value: 5
.RE
.SS "Sequence options"
.PP
\fB\-includedregion\fR \fIrange\fR
.RS 4
A sub\-region of the given sequence in which to pick primers. For example, often the first dozen or so bases of a sequence are vector, and should be excluded from consideration. The value for this parameter has the form (start),(end) where (start) is the index of the first base to consider, and (end) is the last in the primer\-picking region.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-target\fR \fIrange\fR
.RS 4
If one or more Targets is specified then a legal primer pair must flank at least one of them. A Target might be a simple sequence repeat site (for example a CA repeat) or a single\-base\-pair polymorphism. The value should be a space\-separated list of (start),(end) pairs where (start) is the index of the first base of a Target, and (end) is the last E.g. 50,51 requires primers to surround the 2 bases at positions 50 and 51.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-excludedregion\fR \fIrange\fR
.RS 4
Primer oligos may not overlap any region specified in this tag. The associated value must be a space\-separated list of (start),(end) pairs where (start) is the index of the first base of the excluded region, and and (end) is the last. This tag is useful for tasks such as excluding regions of low sequence quality or for excluding regions containing repetitive elements such as ALUs or LINEs. E.g. 401,407 68,70 forbids selection of primers in the 7 bases starting at 401 and the 3 bases at 68.
.RE

.RE
.PP
\fB\-otm\fR \fIfloat\fR
.RS 4
Optimum melting temperature(Celsius) for a primer oligo. EPrimer3 will try to pick primers with melting temperatures are close to this temperature. The oligo melting temperature formula in EPrimer3 is that given in Rychlik, Spencer and Rhoads, Nucleic Acids Research, vol 18, num 12, pp 6409\-6412 and Breslauer, Frank, Bloeker and Marky, Proc.

.RE
.PP
\fB\-saltconc\fR \fIfloat\fR
.RS 4
The millimolar concentration of salt (usually KCl) in the PCR. EPrimer3 uses this argument to calculate oligo melting temperatures. Default value: 50.0
.RE
.PP
\fB\-dnaconc\fR \fIfloat\fR
.RS 4
The nanomolar concentration of annealing oligos in the PCR. EPrimer3 uses this argument to calculate oligo melting temperatures. The default (50nM) works well with the standard protocol used at the Whitehead/MIT Center for Genome Research\-\-0.5 microliters of 20 micromolar concentration for each primer oligo in a 20 microliter reaction with 10 nanograms template, 0.025 units/microliter Taq polymerase in 0.1 mM each dNTP, 1.5mM MgCl2, 50mM KCl, 10mM Tris\-HCL (pH 9.3) using 35 cycles with an annealing temperature of 56 degrees Celsius. This parameter corresponds to 'c' in Rychlik, Spencer and Rhoads' equation (ii) (Nucleic Acids Research, vol 18, num 12) where a suitable value (for a lower initial concentration of template) is 'empirically determined'. The value of this parameter is less than the actual concentration of oligos in the reaction because it is the concentration of annealing oligos, which in turn depends on the amount of template (including PCR product) in a given cycle. This concentration increases a great deal during a PCR; fortunately PCR seems quite robust for a variety of oligo melting temperatures. See ADVICE FOR PICKING PRIMERS. Default value: 50.0
.RE

.RE

\fB\-productosize\fR \fIinteger\fR

The optimum size for the PCR product. 0 indicates that there is no optimum product size. Default value: 200
.RE
.PP
\fB\-productsizerange\fR \fIrange\fR
.RS 4
The associated values specify the lengths of the product that the user wants the primers to create, and is a space separated list of elements of the form (x)\-(y) where an (x)\-(y) pair is a legal range of lengths for the product. For example, if one wants PCR products to be between 100 to 150 bases (inclusive) then one would set this parameter to 100\-150. If one desires PCR products in either the range from 100 to 150 bases or in the range from 200 to 250 bases then one would set this parameter to 100\-150 200\-250. EPrimer3 favors ranges to the left side of the parameter string. EPrimer3 will return legal primers pairs in the first range regardless the value of the objective function for these pairs. Only if there are an insufficient number of primers in the first range will EPrimer3 return primers in a subsequent range. Default value: 100\-300
.RE
.PP
\fB\-productotm\fR \fIfloat\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB\-productmintm\fR \fIfloat\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fB\-productmaxtm\fR \fIfloat\fR
.RS 4
The maximum allowed melting temperature of the amplicon. Product Tm is calculated using the formula from Bolton and McCarthy, PNAS 84:1390 (1962) as presented in Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis, Molecular Cloning, p 11.46 (1989, CSHL Press). Tm = 81.5 + 16.6(log10([Na+])) + .41*(%GC) \- 600/length Where [Na+} is the molar sodium concentration, (%GC) is the percent of Gs and Cs in the sequence, and length is the length of the sequence. A similar formula is used by the prime primer selection program in GCG http://www.gcg.com), which instead uses 675.0/length in the last term (after F. Baldino, Jr, M.\-F. Chesselet, and M.E. Lewis, Methods in Enzymology 168:766 (1989) eqn (1) on page 766 without the mismatch and formamide terms). The formulas here and in Baldino et al. assume Na+ rather than K+. According to J.G. Wetmur, Critical Reviews in BioChem. and Mol. Bio. 26:227 (1991) 50 mM K+ should be equivalent in these formulae to .2 M Na+. EPrimer3 uses the same salt concentration value for calculating both the primer melting temperature and the oligo melting temperature. If you are planning to use the PCR product for hybridization later this behavior will not give you the Tm under hybridization conditions. Default value: 1000000.0

\fB\-oligoexcludedregion\fR \fIrange\fR

Middle oligos may not overlap any region specified by this tag.

The maximum allowable local alignment score when testing an internal oligo for (local) self\-complementarity. Local self\-complementarity is taken to predict the tendency of oligos to anneal to themselves The scoring system gives 1.00 for complementary bases, \-0.25 for a match of any base (or N) with an N, \-1.00 for a mismatch, and \-2.00 for a gap. Only single\-base\-pair gaps are allowed. For example, the alignment 5' ATCGNA 3' || | | 3' TA\-CGT 5' is allowed (and yields a score of 1.75), but the alignment 5' ATCCGNA 3' || | | 3' TA\-\-CGT 5' is not considered. Scores are non\-negative, and a score of 0.00 indicates that there is no reasonable local alignment between two oligos. Default value: 12.00

\fB\-oligoselfend\fR \fIfloat\fR

The maximum allowable 3'\-anchored global alignment score when testing a single oligo for self\-complementarity. The scoring system is as for the Maximum Complementarity argument. In the examples above the scores are 7.00 and 6.00 respectively. Scores are non\-negative, and a score of 0.00 indicates that there is no reasonable 3'\-anchored global alignment between two oligos. In order to estimate 3'\-anchored global alignments for candidate oligos, Primer assumes that the sequence from which to choose oligos is presented 5' to 3'. INTERNAL\-OLIGO\-SELF\-END is meaningless when applied to internal oligos used for hybridization\-based detection, since primer\-dimer will not occur. We recommend that INTERNAL\-OLIGO\-SELF\-END be set at least as high as INTERNAL\-OLIGO\-SELF\-ANY. Default value: 12.00

The maximum allowable local alignment score when testing a single primer for (local) self\-complementarity and the maximum allowable local alignment score when testing for complementarity between forward and reverse primers. Local self\-complementarity is taken to predict the tendency of primers to anneal to each other without necessarily causing self\-priming in the PCR. The scoring system gives 1.00 for complementary bases, \-0.25 for a match of any base (or N) with an N, \-1.00 for a mismatch, and \-2.00 for a gap. Only single\-base\-pair gaps are allowed. For example, the alignment 5' ATCGNA 3' ...|| | | 3' TA\-CGT 5' is allowed (and yields a score of 1.75), but the alignment 5' ATCCGNA 3' ...|| | | 3' TA\-\-CGT 5' is not considered.

The maximum allowable 3'\-anchored global alignment score when testing a single primer for self\-complementarity, and the maximum allowable 3'\-anchored global alignment score when testing for complementarity between forward and reverse primers. The 3'\-anchored global alignment score is taken to predict the likelihood of PCR\-priming primer\-dimers, for example 5' ATGCCCTAGCTTCCGGATG 3' .............||| ||||| ..........3' AAGTCCTACATTTAGCCTAGT 5' or 5' AGGCTATGGGCCTCGCGA 3' ...............|||||| ............3' AGCGCTCCGGGTATCGGA 5' The scoring system is as for the Maximum Complementarity argument. In the examples above the scores are 7.00 and 6.00 respectively. Scores are non\-negative, and a score of 0.00 indicates that there is no reasonable 3'\-anchored global alignment between two oligos. In order to estimate 3'\-anchored global alignments for candidate primers and primer pairs, Primer assumes that the sequence from which to choose primers is presented 5' to 3'. It is nonsensical to provide a larger value for this parameter than for the Maximum (local) Complementarity parameter because the score of a local alignment will always be at least as great as the score of a global alignment.

The value is the maximum delta G for duplex disruption for the five 3' bases as calculated using the nearest neighbor parameters published in Breslauer, Frank, Bloeker and Marky, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol 83, pp 3746\-3750. EPrimer3 uses a completely permissive default value for backward compatibility (which we may change in the next release). Rychlik recommends a maximum value of 9 (Wojciech Rychlik, 'Selection of Primers for Polymerase Chain Reaction' in BA White, Ed., 'Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 15: PCR Protocols: Current Methods and Applications', 1993, pp 31\-40, Humana Press, Totowa NJ). Default value: 9.0
