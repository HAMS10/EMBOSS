# EMBOSS unfortunately uses a modified copy of the PCRE library. Upstream
# understands the problems it causes for us, but will not remove it in the
# short term. The other embedded and modified library is PLplot. Thanks
# to Upstream's efforts, the emboss packages in Debian can be built
# against Debian's zlib and expat libraries instead of the convenience code
# copies in the original upstream sources.
